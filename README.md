IOS Bluetooth Program
                                         Pei.ZHANG pei.zhang@student.yncrea.fr
Project Objective
Write a simple Bluetooth demo program to connect the microcontroller. Can send data to control the movement of the wheelchair, or can receive data to get the location of the wheelchair.
Completed part
The program can now scan for surrounding Bluetooth devices. After pressing to stop scanning, all connectable devices will be displayed in the menu bar. Click on the device you want to connect to connect. After that, the program will find the corresponding service and characteristics according to uuid. If not found, it will automatically disconnect. After the connection is successfully established, the received data will be displayed in the text box. If you click the move button, a data will be sent to the microcontroller (it has no meaning, it is only used as a test). All data are represented in hexadecimal asicc codes.
Unfinished part
Convert the received data into the form of coordinates, and add a virtual joystick to control the movement of the wheelchair, and you can also add the function of voice control
project description
This program uses a central model
Import CoreBluetooth framework, #import <CoreBluetooth / CoreBluetooth.h>
Comply with CBCentralManagerDelegate, CBPeripheralDelegate agreement
central: The device connected to the hardware.
peripheral: peripheral, connected hardware.
Note: Peripherals are always broadcasting.When the central object you create is scanning peripherals, you can discover peripherals.

Note: A peripheral device contains multiple services, and each service contains multiple features. Features include feature values and feature descriptions. Each service contains multiple fields. The permissions of the fields are read, write, notify.

Central Model Process
1. Establish the central role [[CBCentralManager alloc] initWithDelegate: self queue: nil]
2.Scan peripherals: cancelPeripheralConnection
3. Discover the peripheral: didDiscoverPeripheral
4. connect peripherals: connectPeripheral
4.1 connection failed: didFailToConnectPeripheral
4.2 disconnected: didDisconnectPeripheral
4.3 Connected successfully: didConnectPeripheral
5. Scan services in peripherals: discoverServices
5.1 Discovering and Obtaining Services in Peripherals: didDiscoverServices
6. Scan the characteristics of corresponding services of peripherals: discoverCharacteristics
6.1 Discover and obtain the characteristics of the corresponding service of the peripheral: didDiscoverCharacteristicsForService
6.2 Write data to the corresponding feature writeValue: forCharacteristic: type:
7. Notification of subscription characteristics setNotifyValue: forCharacteristic:
7.1 Read data based on characteristics: didUpdateValueForCharacteristic

Note: After the iOS version is updated, the Bluetooth certificate may also need to be updated or it cannot be used normally. For details, please refer to the official document.
